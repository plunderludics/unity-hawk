 - bug: hacky focus stuff seems to mess with unity modal windows, pretty annoying [at least this only happens in play mode now]

 - add tests (including of build process)

 - pass modifier keys with input (would be useful for e.g. shift-tab to turbo)

 - fix flaky build script by making a custom build pipeline

 - improve unity<->lua (callmethod) interface
  - ideally support passing arbitrary structs (or at least primitive types other than just strings)
  - maybe better interface for registering methods on the unity side, current setup feels flaky
  - realised that the call to unity from lua is synchronous (blocking) rn, it really shouldn't be

 - update BizHawk (to 2.9.1?)

 X pass current frame count along with texture to make syncing possible
 - and perhaps a built-in solution for frame-perfect syncing (between lua rpc calls and the texture)?

 - annoying bug: exceptions thrown inside methods called over rpc (from lua) are invisible because not on the main thread

 - demo scene including savestates & lua scripts

 - mac / linux support?? may be possible if the unsupported dependencies on mac os are input / grahpics / audio related
  - [SharedMemory library seems to not work on mac - it's possible to implement the shared buffers using NamedPipes instead, but I realised that neither of the PSX cores work on mac, and it seems like a lot of work to fix that, so unlikely this will ever happen]
  - [linux probably much easier, and apparently supports most cores other than N64]

 - cleanup code
  - move nasty audio stuff into another class

 - improve ipc audio
  - currently either crackly audio or high-latency, especially with multiple simultaneous emulators
  - two separate rpc channels seems unnecessary and probably increases latency
  - i think it would make a lot more sense to do resampling on the unity side instead of bizhawk side, that would simplify the rpc stuff too
   - maybe just copy the code from SoundOutputProvider.cs, rather than have a depemdency on a bunch of bizhawk dlls

 - expand bizhawk api call interface?
  - could add methods for read/write ram, seems unnecessary tho imo [can just do it from lua and communicate via unityhawk.callmethod()]

 - documentation! at least a guide to the params on the Emulator component

 - option to reduce build size by including savestates but not roms (possible for samples that never need to load from disk)

 - better process for building and updating the upm branch
 
 - tweak default config to not spew so much stuff into the Packages/ directory

minor:
 - ideally put the protocol / schema for the texture buffer format (and input/audio in the future) somewhere shared
 - pause bizhawk when unity editor is paused [https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorApplication-pauseStateChanged.html]
 - should log an error if unable to connect to ipc buffers after x amount of time
