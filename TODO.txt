 - pass modifier keys with input (would be useful for e.g. shift-tab to turbo)
 - fix flaky build script by making a custom build pipeline
 - have a nice interface (for unityhawk users) to interact with the bizhawk apis (e.g. for loading state, reading/writing memory, etc)

 - improve unity<->lua (callmethod) interface
  - ideally support passing arbitrary structs (or at least primitive types other than just strings)
  - maybe better interface for registering methods on the unity side, current setup feels flaky

 - update BizHawk (to 2.9.1?)

 - restart emulator when params change

 - demo scene including savestates & lua scripts

 - mac / linux support?? may be possible if the unsupported dependencies on mac os are input / grahpics / audio related
  - [have made some progress on this but current blocker is the SharedMemory library seeming to not work on mac]

 - cleanup code
  - move nasty audio stuff into another class
  - probably separate all the de/serialization, shared buffer & rpc stuff into separate files too

 - improve ipc audio
  - currently either crackly audio or high-latency, especially with multiple simultaneous emulators
  - two separate rpc channels seems unnecessary and probably increases latency
  - i think it would make a lot more sense to do resampling on the unity side instead of bizhawk side, that would simplify the rpc stuff too
   - maybe just copy the code from SoundOutputProvider.cs, rather than have a depemdency on a bunch of bizhawk dlls

 - documentation! at least a guide to the params on the Emulator component

 - option to reduce build size by including savestates but not roms (possible for samples that never need to load from disk)

 - fix annoying behavior where emulator resets when you hit ctrl-z in editor [why does unity call OnDisable + OnEnable whenever you undo in the editor? seems to be not documented anywhere]

 - better process for building and updating the upm branch

minor:
 - ideally put the protocol / schema for the texture buffer format (and input/audio in the future) somewhere shared
 - pause bizhawk when unity editor is paused [https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorApplication-pauseStateChanged.html]
 - should log an error if unable to connect to ipc buffers after x amount of time
